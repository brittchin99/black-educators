Her success with inner-city children led to her own television film and gained attention from figures including President Ronald Reagan.</p>\n      <Link className=\"btn btn-secondary\" to=\"/biography\">Read more about Marva</Link>\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"section-block\" style={{paddingLeft: '40px', paddingRight: '40px', backgroundColor: '#151414', color: 'white'}}>\n      <h3>Why I Am Interested</h3>\n      <p>I first heard about Marva Collins in my Black Educator Narratives class, after reading <i>Cutting School: The Segrenomics of American Education</i>. I was surprised that as a college student, I had never heard of her before in the course of my education.</p>\n      <p>I chose to focus on Marva Collins for this assignment because I was inspired by her commitment to teaching children who had been labeled as “unteachable” by the public school system. We have learned this semester that Black and brown students are disproportionately labelled as special needs and troubled at a higher rate. These children have certain futures placed on them solely based on the color of their skin and racial stereotypes. Marva rejected these assumptions and believed that any child had the ability to succeed. She gave Black children the encouragement and support they needed to success, and her results speak for themselves. I also found it admirable that she rejected multiple positions that probably would have brought a lot of money and status. This shows that she cared more about the quality of education for the children she taught than money or fame.</p>\n      </div>\n      \n      <div className=\"section-block\">\n        <table style={{borderSpacing: 15}}>\n          <tr>\n            <td className=\"left pad-r\">\n              <h3>Timeline</h3>\n            <p>Marva Collins fought for educational equality and supported Black students throughout the course of her life.</p>\n              <Link className=\"btn btn-secondary\" to=\"/timeline\">View timeline</Link>\n            </td>\n            <td className=\"right\">\n            <img style={{width: '100%', display: 'block', objectFit: 'cover'}} src={marva1} alt=\"marva\"></img>\n            </td>\n          </tr>\n        </table>\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"section-block\" style={{ backgroundColor: '#151414', color: 'white'}}>\n        <table style={{borderSpacing: 15}}>\n          <tr>\n          <td className=\"right\">\n            <img style={{width: '100%', display: 'block', objectFit: 'cover'}} src={marva4} alt=\"marva\"></img>\n            </td>\n            <td className=\"left pad-l\">\n            <h3>Collective Memory</h3>\n            <p>Marva is remembered as an educator who used her unconventional teaching methods to bring success to poor students of color.</p>\n              <Link className=\"btn btn-secondary\" to=\"/memory\">Learn about Marva's Legacy</Link>\n            </td>\n          </tr>\n        </table>\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"section-block\">\n        <table style={{borderSpacing: 15}}>\n          <tr>\n            <td className=\"left pad-r\">\n            <h3>Marva and Horace Tate</h3>\n            <p>Both Marva and Horace believed that it was an educator's role to want the same education for Black children as they would want for their own.</p>\n              <Link className=\"btn btn-secondary\" to=\"/marvaandtate\">See similarities between Marva and Horace</Link>\n            </td>\n            <td className=\"right\">\n            <img style={{width: '100%', display: 'block', objectFit: 'cover'}} src={tate} alt=\"tate\"></img>\n            </td>\n          </tr>\n        </table>\n      </div>\n\n      </>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default HomeComponent;\n","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\nimport { VerticalTimeline, VerticalTimelineElement }  from 'react-vertical-timeline-component';\nimport './Components.css';\nimport 'react-vertical-timeline-component/style.min.css';\n\nclass TimelineComponent extends Component {\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n    window.scrollTo(0, 0)\n  }\n  \n  render() {\n    return (\n      <>\n      <h1 className=\"page-header\">Timeline</h1>\n       <VerticalTimeline>\n        <VerticalTimelineElement\n          className=\"vertical-timeline-element\"\n          contentStyle={{ background: '#adadad', color: 'white' }}\n          contentArrowStyle={{ borderRight: '7px solid  #adadad' }}\n          date=\"1961\"\n        >\n          <h4 className=\"vertical-timeline-element-title\">Began working for Chicago Public School System</h4>\n          <p>\n          After teaching in Alabama for 2 years, Marva moved to Chicago and worked with the public school system for 14 years. However, she became increasingly dissatisfied with its apathy, neglect, and hostility toward inner-city students, most of whom were poor and Black. She was not pleased with the education her own children were receiving and wanted more for both them and the other public school children.\n          </p>\n        </VerticalTimelineElement>\n        <VerticalTimelineElement\n          className=\"vertical-timeline-element\"\n          contentStyle={{ background: '#adadad', color: 'white' }}\n          contentArrowStyle={{ borderRight: '7px solid  #adadad' }}\n          date=\"1975\"\n        >\n          <h4 className=\"vertical-timeline-element-title\">Opens the Westside Perparatory School</h4>\n          <p>\n          Marva decided to break from the public school system to establish her own school in the basement of Daniel Hale Williams University. Here she organized her own rigorous school system that was designed to cultivate students independence and accomplishment. She began with 4 students, and within a year increased enrollment to 20 students. At the end of her first year, every student scored at least five grades higher on their standardized tests.\n          <br/><br/>\n          After a few years in the university, she moved the school to the second floor of her home in order to be free of government regulations. Within Westside Preparatory, Marva taught students who were deemed “unteachable” and who had been rejected by other schools. She had high standards and unorthodox methods, teaching the Socratic method and the classics in addition to traditional subjects. The key to the success of her school, though, was that she believed no child could fail.\n          </p>\n        </VerticalTimelineElement>\n        <VerticalTimelineElement\n          className=\"vertical-timeline-element\"\n          contentStyle={{ background: '#adadad', color: 'white' }}\n          contentArrowStyle={{ borderRight: '7px solid  #adadad' }}\n          date=\"1979\"\n        >\n          <h4 className=\"vertical-timeline-element-title\">Marva attracts Media Attention</h4>\n          <p>\n          Following a story and interview with 60 Minutes on the success of her school and teaching methods, Marva began to receive national prominence. She was featured in several magazines including Time, Jet, Newsweek, and Black Enterprise. These stories focused particularly on the fact that many students taught by Collins's methods showed dramatic improvement in their test scores as well as success in later life.\n          <br/><br/>\n          In addition to media attention, Marva was also contacted by political figures due to the success of her teaching. Ronald Reagan offered her the position of Secretary of Education, a position she ultimately turned down.

She received her education in Atmore, Alabama during a time where segregation was still in effect, thus resources for African American’s were scarce. After attending college at Clark College in Atlanta, she returned to Alabama to teach for 2 years. She then moved to Chicago to work in public schooling for 14 years.</p>\n            <p>Throughout those years teaching in Chicago, Marva became increasingly displeased with the public school system, which she found to be failing inner-city children, most of whom were poor and Black. She was tired of the low standards for achievement, and hence was inspired to break from public education and open her own school in the basement of Daniel Hale Williams University. Westside Preparatory School welcomed students who were deemed “unteachable” by other schools. Marva taught students phonics, the Socratic method, and the classics, and insisted that she never expected students to fail.</p>\n        </div>\n        </div>\n\n      <div className=\"bubble\">\n      <p className=\"quote\">“Kids don’t fail.
